# Personal Arduino Projects
A collection of small personal projects for Arduino using minimal hardware.

---

## RGB LED Controlled by Gyroscope
This project reads values from a gyroscope, converting them to a scale from 1 to 255 to adjust the colors of an RGB LED.

---

## Morse Code Machine
A program to create a small Morse code device using a buzzer and a switch. It simulates the sound and appearance of an old Morse code machine.

---

## Voltmeter
Simple code that turns an Arduino into a basic voltmeter.

---

## Music and Sound
This project enables the Arduino to play music on a buzzer. By manually transcribing sheet music, it automatically converts each note to its corresponding sound frequency and lights up the LED associated with that note.

### Notes and Pins

| Note | Pin |
|------|-----|
| Do   | 11  |
| Re   | 10  |
| Mi   | 9   |
| Fa   | 7   |
| Sol  | 6   |
| La   | 5   |
| Si   | 4   |

- **Buzzer:** Pin 8
- **Status LED:** Pin 13 (lights briefly each time a note is played)

The status LED provides visual feedback, especially helpful when a note repeats often or is played in different octaves. If the note is sharp or flat, the LED blinks so quickly itâ€™s almost imperceptible.

As it stands, the code plays the "Imperial March" from *Star Wars*.
